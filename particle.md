# The Particle Core (aka Spark Core)

## Setting Up Your Particle

NodeBoats will use the [Particle Core](https://www.particle.io) (formerly known as the Spark). This is a microcontroller, similar to the Arduino in functionality, but with an integrated wifi chip. Perfect for Bots, like Boats, that need to be physically untethered from your computer!
